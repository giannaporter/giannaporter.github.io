	<p style="text-align:center;"><font face="Trebuchet MS">Playing tennis is near and dear to my heart.  It is one of those sports that can be played throughout a lifetime. My desire to learn to play tennis started when I was in middle school while watching my brother play high school tennis. His love for the game and the intensity of the play, inspired me to try out for the tennis team when I entered high school. Before I trying for the team, my brother and father practiced with me and taught me the basic skills of the game. As a freshmen, facing 50 other girls for 12 spots on the tennis team was quite intimidating.  However, as a freshman, the coach saw potential in my skills and I made the team. My first year, I held the spot of 2nd doubles and moved to 1st doubles as a sophomore.  By my junior year, I was playing singles and as a senior we competed weekly for top singles, which I had the opportunity to fulfill that role on several occasions.  As mentioned previously, tennis is a lifelong sport. Since entering UMaine 3 years ago, I have had several opportunities to play tennis on the UMaine tennis courts. In closing, I still see myself many years down the road still playing tennis with my friends and family.</p><br></br>
